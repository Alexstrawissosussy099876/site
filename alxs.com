<p>Hi! welcome to ALXS.org. this is a webpage that focuses on articles and tech. Today we will be discussing:</p>

<p>Is a 365 subscription really worth it;</p>
<p>Short round</p>

<p>now, lets start off. the best os's</p>
<p>Linux/ubuntu. this is a reasonably simple os that can be dual booted with windows. good for coding. 75/100</p>
<p>windows xp. This was the height of windows and was really good. windows is quite poor these days. 71/100</p>
<p>mac os (latest version). mac os is generally a good os on a good computer. really good to work with. 80/100</p>
<p>Now... for the WORST os's EVER MADE!&nbsp;</p>
<p>windows 11. now, this may be a surprise for some, but windows 11 is one of the worst. a bad layout and nothing special.</p>
<p>mac os x (2001). considering by now windows were releasing windows 7, this only compared to os's like windows 98.</p>
<p>Huawei. This is a terrible os made for terrible devices by a terrible company. the emojis are even worse! this is definitely the bottom of our list.</p>

<p>IS A 365 SUBSCRIPTION WORTH IT?</p>
<p>Well, yes. you get 100 gb's of one-drive cloud data that you can use without filling your computer's hard disk. you also get access (do you get it ;)) to key 365 apps, for example word, PowerPoint and Excel. This is a very key subscription especially if you work on a laptop or PC, so you don't end up using apps like sticky notes which aren't really very good apps. the subscription is also a reasonable price, meaning you don't have to spend too much money on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SHORT ROUND</p>
<p>I may just be on my own here, but I think Short round is really great. Like, just, hold onto your potatoes and you'll just love him. Just a shame we never saw him again after TOD (temple of doom).</p>

<p>He's just a great guy. He likes short roun too. I am running low on Ideas for articles now so if you happen to be interested enough to read this far, then please do leave ideas in the comments box on GitHub. I'll make sure most of them make it into articles.</p>
